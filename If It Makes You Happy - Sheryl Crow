[Intro]
G
 
[Verse 1]
 
          G                      G
I've been long, a long way from here
G
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes,
    G                          C*
And drank 'til I was thirsty again
 
        G                               G
We went searching through thrift store jungles
        G
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
    G                           C*
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
 
       C                D      C                            D
Well, okay, I made this up…  I promised you I'd never give up
 
 
[Chorus]
 
N.C.             Am   C                  G          D
If it makes you happy   it can't be that ba-aa-aa-ad
                 Am   C                            G
If it makes you happy   then why the hell are you so sad?
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
         G          G
You get down, real low down
    G
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
      G                         C
Well, who hasn't been there before?
 
       G                  G
I come round, around the hard way
          G
Bring you comics in bed; scrape the mold off the bread,
    G                          C
And serve you French toast again
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
 
       C                D            C                               D
Well, okay, I still get stoned…  I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home
 
 
[Chorus]
 
N.C.             Am   C                  G          D
If it makes you happy   it can't be that ba-aa-aa-ad
                 Am   C                            G
If it makes you happy   then why the hell are you so sad?
 
                 Am   C                  G          D
If it makes you happy   it can't be that ba-aa-aa-ad
                 Am   C                            Em
If it makes you happy   then why the hell are you so sad?
 
 
[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
 
            G                  G
We've been far, far away from here
G
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitoes,
    G                  C*
And everywhere in between
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 3]
 
       C             D        C                                D
Well, okay, we get along…  so what if right now everything's wrong?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
N.C.             Am   C                  G          D
If it makes you happy   it can't be that ba-aa-aa-ad
                 Am   C                            G
If it makes you happy   then why the hell are you so sad?
 
                 Am   C                  G          D
If it makes you happy   it can't be that ba-aa-aa-ad
                 Am   C                            G
If it makes you happy   then why the hell are you so sad?
