[Verse 1]
      C
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
       G                                 F
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey, hey, hey
     C
She acts like summer and walks like rain
   G                                          F
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey, hey, hey
  C
Since the return from her stay on the moon
      G                                                F
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
 
[Chorus]
G                                 D
Tell me did you sail across the sun
                               F
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
C
  And that heaven is overrated
G                                       D
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star
                          Dm
One without a permanent scar
                                   F
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

[Verse 2]
      C
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
G                                           F
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey, hey
      C
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
   G                                      F
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey, hey, hey
      C
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
       G                                   F
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
 
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
 
[Chorus]
G                                       D
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
                                  F
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
C
  And head back to the Milky Way
    G                            D
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
                                Dm
Was it everything you wanted to find
                                   F
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

[Bridge]
                   C
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
     G                           F
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
                   C                                 G
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
    Bb                                   F
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me
 
[Chorus]
G                                       D
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
                                  F
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
C
  And head back toward the Milky Way
G                               D
Tell me did you sail across the sun
                             F
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
C
  And that heaven is overrated
G                                     D
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star
                        Dm
One without a permanent scar
                                   F
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself
 
[Outro]
C
Na na na na na na
G                 F
Na na na na na na na-na-na-na
 
And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
C
Na na na na na na
G
Na na na na na na
            F
            (na-na-na-na)
And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star
C
Na na na na na na
G
Na na na na na na
           Bb                           F
And are ya lonely looking for yourself out there
