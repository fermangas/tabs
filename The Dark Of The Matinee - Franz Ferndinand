[Verse 1]
 
C#m                 B
You take your white finger
F#m
Slide the nail under
                           C#m
the top and bottom buttons of
   B
my blazer
F#m
Relax the fraying wool, slacken ties
        A                   E                    Bm
And I'm not to look at you in the shoe, but the eyes
D
Find the eyes
 
 
[Chorus]
 
   Bm
So find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and
D
files you must follow, leave this academic factory you will
Bm
find me in the matinee, the dark of the matinee. It's
D                                                 A
better in the matinee, the dark of the matinee is mine
         C#m  B  F#   C#m
yes it's mi----ine
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C#m              B   F#m
I time every journey, to bump into you, accidentally I
C#m            B        F#m
 charm you and tell you   of the boys I hate
                      A
all the girls I hate, all the words I hate
                      F#m
all the clothes I hate, how I'll never be anything I hate
   A                         E
You smile, mention something that you like,
                 Bm
how you'd have a happy life
                D
if you did the things you like
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  Bm
So find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and
D
files you must follow, leave this academic factory you will
Bm
find me in the matinee, the dark of the matinee. It's
D                                                 A
better in the matinee, the dark of the matinee is mine
         C#m  B  F#m
yes it's mi----ine
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C#m           B     F#m
 So I'm on BBC2 now, telling Terry Wogan how I made it
    C#m              B
And what I made is unclear now
F#m
But his deference is and his laughter is
A                          E
 My words and smile are so easy now
           Bm                 D
Yes, it's easy now, yes, it's easy now
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  Bm
So find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and
D
files you must follow, leave this academic factory you will
Bm
find me in the matinee, the dark of the matinee. It's
D
better in the matinee, the dark of the matinee
 
  Bm
Well find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and
D
files you must follow, leave this academic factory you will
Bm
find me in the matinee, the dark of the matinee. It's
D                                                 A
better in the matinee, the dark of the matinee is mine
         C#m  B  F#m   C#
yes it's mi----ine
