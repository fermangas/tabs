files you ... follow, leave this academic factory you'll
Bm
find me in the matinee, the dark of the matinee. It's
D                                                 A

C#m          B         F#m
 But I'm BBC two  now, telling Terry Wogan how I made it
    C#m              B

F#m
But his laughter is and his defference is
A                                           E
Words and smile... well they're easy now

Yes, it's easy now, yes, it's easy now
