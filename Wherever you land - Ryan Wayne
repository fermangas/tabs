
Wherever You Land - Ryan Wayne

[Intro]
G Gsus4 G


[Verse 1]
       C
For a year of great hope and great expectations

     G 
The bottom came fast and hard and replaced it

        Am              Am/B C
With a look deep within our own convictions

   G                      D
If it's ever over will we even believe it


[Chorus]
     Am                    Am/B C
We shout across the alleyways, down from the fire escapes

    G                          D
To neighbors so distant in our own private prisons

          Am                             C
May your golden torch flicker bove' the Rochester Dam

         G                             D    G G/B G
May you find Paradise in wherever you land


[Verse 2]
       C         
Now I see your blackbirds they fill up the sky

     G
The wind through the willows it fades into night

       Am             Am/B C
Soft snowflakes in April slow down the time

    G                       D
The old world has left us alone but in spite we'll still


[Chorus]
  Am                         C
Shout across the alleyways, down from the fire escapes

    G                          D
To neighbors so distant in our own private prisons

          Am                             C
May Your golden torch flicker bove' the Rochester Dam

         G                   D
May you find Paradise in wherever you land
