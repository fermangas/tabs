[Verse 1] - Arpegiated chord, acoustic
[40] I've got another confession to make, I'm your fool
[40] Everyone's got their chains to break, Holding you
[20] Were you born to resist or be abused?

[Same]
[420] Is someone getting the best, the best, the best The best of you?
[420] Is someone getting the best, the best, the best The best of you?
[420] Are you gone and on to someone new? [Let it ring, drums start]


                      [4th fret, downstroke power chords, crunchy]
[40] I needed somewhere to hang my head Without your noose
[40] You gave me something that I didn't have But had no use
[20] I was too weak to give in Too strong to lose
[40] My heart is under arrest again But I break loose
[40] My head is giving me life or death But I can't choose
[20] I swear I'll never give in I refuse


[Loop Record]
[420F#] Is someone getting the best, the best, the best The best of you?
[Loop play]
[420F#] Is someone getting the best, the best, the best The best of you?
[11th fret]
[420F#] Has someone taken your faith? It's real, the pain you feel Your trust, you must confess
[420F#] Is someone getting the best, the best, the best The best of you?

[Fast stroke octave figure, twice]

Oh
[Strumming, same as the verse, chruncy]
Oh, ho-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

[Verse 3 ] - Power chords - ascending scale
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
Your trust, you must confess

[Chorus] - Power chords - ascending scale
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?

                             [Arpegiated chords, Less crunchy]
I've got another confession, my friend 
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

                    [Downstroke Power chords, crunchy]
Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse [Full band Break-out]

[Chorus] - Power chords - ascending scale
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?

[Chorus] - Power chords - ascending scale
Has someone taken your faith
It's real, the pain you feel
Your trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best
The best of you?
Oh
