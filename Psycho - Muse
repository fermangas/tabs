[Intro]
 
Dm... A, Gm, F, A7, Dm
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Dm
Love, it will get you nowhere
                F    C
You are on your own
            G
Lost in the wild
 
           Dm
So come to me now
                 Dm
I could use some-one like you
               F  C           G
Someone who'll ki-ll on my co-mmand
           Dm
And ask no quest-ions
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Dm
  (I'm gonna make you)
Dm
  (I'm gonna break you)
Dm
  (I'm gonna make you)
Dm7
  A fucking psycho
 
Dm, Dm, Dm, Dm7 x2
             (A fucking psycho)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
     A              Gm            F   A7
Your ass belongs to me no-o-o-o-o-ow, oh
 
[Bridge]
 
Dm
Are you a human drone? (Aye, sir!)
Are you a killing machine? (Aye, sir!)
I'm in control, motherfucker, do you understand? (Aye, sir!)
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
     Dm
Your mind is just a program
          F  C
and I'm a vi-rus
                 G
I'm changing the sta-tion
                  Dm
I'll improve your thres-holds
                     Dm
I'll turn you into a su-per drone (a super drone)
             F  C           G
And you will ki-ll on my co-mmand
              Dm
I won't be re-sponsible
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Dm
  (I'm gonna make you)
Dm
  (I'm gonna break you)
Dm
  (I'm gonna make you)
Dm7
  A fucking psycho
 
Dm, Dm, Dm, Dm7 x2
             (A fucking psycho)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
     A              Gm            F  A7
Your ass belongs to me no-o-o-o-o-ow, oh
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Dm
Are you a psycho killer? Say "I'm a psycho killer!"
(I am a psycho killer!)
Scream it!
(I am a psycho killer!)
Show me your war face!
(AHHHH!)
You are a pussy! I said show me your war face!
(AHHHH!)
 
 
[Pre-chorus]

Dm
  (I'm gonna make you)
Dm7
  A fucking psycho
 
Dm, Dm, Dm, Dm7 x2
             (A fucking psycho)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
     A              Gm            F  A7
Your ass belongs to me no-o-o-o-o-ow, oh
 
Dm
 
 
[Outro]
 
     A              Gm
Your ass belongs to me now
     A              Gm            F  A7
Your ass belongs to me no-o-o-o-o-ow, oh
 
Dm
