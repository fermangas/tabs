[Verse 1]
Down around the corner / Half a mile from here / See them long trains runnin' And you watch 'em disappear
Without love Where would you be now? (Without love)

[Verse 2]
Know I saw Miss Lucy / Down along the tracks/ She lost her home and her family/ And she won't be coming back
Without love Where would you be now? (Without love)

[Verse 3] Bass and Guitar only at 1
Well, the Illinois Central / And the Southern Central freight/ Got to keep on pushin' mama/ 'Cause you know they're runnin' late
Without love Where would you be now? (Without love)

[Solo]
[Harmony is the same as the whole verse and chorus]

[Verse 4] Bass and Guitar only at 1
Well, the Illinois Central / And the Southern Central freight / Got to keep on pushin' mama / You know they're runnin' late
Without love Where would you be now? (Without love)

[Verse 5] Stacatto on every beat
Well, pistons keep on churnin' / And the wheels go 'round and 'round / And the steel rails lie cold / And hard on the mountains they go down
Without love Where would you be now? (Without love) 
Ooh, where would you be now?   [PAUSE]

[Guitar intro]
Mmm, got to get you baby-baby
Won't you move it down?
Won't you move it down?
Baby-baby-baby-baby
Won't you move it down?
When the big train run
When the train I'm movin' on
I got to keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Won't you keep on movin'?
Won't you keep on movin'?

Coda Ad-Lib Lyrics:
 
Mmmm  Got to get-cha ba-by  Ba-by won’t you move it down
Won’t you move it down  Ba-by, ba-by, ba-by, ba-by
Won’t you move it down  where the big trains run
And the train ‘a mov-in’  Got to keep on mov-in’
Keep on mov-in’  Won’t you keep on mov-in’  Got-ta keep on mov-in’
