[Verse 1]

Am            Em/G
I know it's true
Am          Em/G 
It's all because of you
Am                  F
And if I make it through
     E               E/A Am
It's all because of you


[Verse 2]

Am            Em/G
And now and then
Am           Em/G
If we must start again
Am              F
Well, we will know for sure
     E       E/A  Am
That I will love you

G
Now and then
   Bm
I miss you
     Em
Oh, now and then
   Am              D
I want you to be there for me
Am           D
Always to return to me



[Verse 3]

Am            Em/G
I know it's true
Am          Em/G 
It's all because of you
Am          F
And if you go away
    E                 E/A Am
I know you'll never stay


[Chorus]

G
Now and then
   Bm
I miss you
     Em
Oh, now and then
   Am              D
I want you to be there for me
