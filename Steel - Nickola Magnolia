[Verse 1]

Am             	    E   
Well you walked in, turned your head
G                F
hair greased up, leather jacket on 
      Am                  E   
your back, your had that look in your eye
G                         F
You wore a little crooked grin on your face.
      Am                 E   
From that point on I wanted to sing you 
G                   F               Am            Em 
songs, stay up all night 'till the sun comes up
G          Am            Asus2 Am
'till the sun comes up


[Chorus]
 
Am  
And when I look to your eyes
   F
I see your future, seen the light 
   C
I walk straight to you 
   G
I walk straight to you


[Verse 2]

Am             	                   E    
These knots barn doors making the sounds they do
       G                  F              Am
These pick up trucks and songs to sing along
                     E            G        F 
There's enough full belly banjos ringing 'round.
       Am              Em 
This steel guitar and record spinning
G               F                  Am    Em
Sunshine waits kissing under the trees
G            Am
under the trees

[Chorus]

Am  
And when I look to your eyes
   F
I see your future, seen the light 
   C
I walk straight to you 
   G
I walk straight to you
 

[Instrumental]
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh.

[Verse 3]

Am                             E
These dreams we share, these things we grow
         G                     F
Theres knots, gray hairs, and county affairs...
         Am               E                  G     F
There's music in parks, stories told in the dark
      Am            Em 
And there you are, looking at me
       G                 F
those deep brown eyes, big as can be
     Am	             Em    G       Am  Asus2 Am 
the first and last I ever want to see.


[Chorus]

Am  
And when I look to your eyes
   F
I see your future, seen the light 
   C
I walk straight to you 
   G
I walk straight to you

[Chorus]

Am  
And when I look to your eyes
   F
I see your future, seen the light 
   C
I walk straight to you 
   G
I walk straight to you
