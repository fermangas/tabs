[Intro]

[Verse 1]
             C
I try to discover
                       G
A little something to make me sweeter
            E                      F
Oh baby, refrain from breaking my heart
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           C
I'm so in love with you
           G
I'll be forever blue
                    F
That you give me no reason
                     Am
Why you're making me work so hard
 
G
That you give me no, that you give me no
 
That you give me no, that you give me no
 
[Chorus]
C                 Am
Soul, I hear you calling
           F                     Em   F  G  C
Oh baby, please give a little respect to-oo me

C
 
[Verse 2]
                 C
And if I should falter
                     G
Would you open your arms out to me
                       E
We can make love, not war
                            F
And live at peace with our hearts
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           C
I'm so in love with you
           G
I'll be forever blue
                 F
What religion or reason
                        Am
Could drive a man to forsake his lover
G
Don't you tell me no, don't you tell me no
 
Don't you tell me no, don't you tell me no
 
[Chorus]
C                 Am
Soul, I hear you calling
           F                     Em   F  G  C
Oh baby, please give a little respect to-oo me
