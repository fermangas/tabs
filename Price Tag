Price Tag

[1] Do the ligato and chord stroke
[2] Do the 6ths arreglo

Okay, Coconut Man, Moonhead and Pea
You ready? [1]
 
Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night 
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Just [BREAK] stop for a minute and [GO] smile

Why is everybody so serious? 
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes and your heels so high
That you can't [1] even have a good time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that? Yeah
We're paying with love tonight [1]

[CHORUS STRUMMING]
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag [1]
 
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag [1]

[VERSE STRUMMING]
We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one getting tired? [1]


[2] Why is everybody so obsessed? 
Money can't buy us happiness 
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

[2] Everybody look to their left (to their left)
Everybody look to their right (to their right)
Can you feel that? Yeah
We're paying with love tonight

[CHORUS]
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag [1]

Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag (yeah, yeah) [1]
 
[RAP]
[2] Well, keep the price tag (yeah) and take the cash back (back)
Just give me six strings (six strings) and a half stack (half stack)
And you can, can keep the cars, leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars
[2] And guess what? In 30 seconds, I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this, man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night
[2] So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never [BAND BREAK] (nah)
Waiting to see this in the sign of defeat [BAND BREAK], uh-uh
So w e gon' keep everyone moving their feet [ALL BREAK]
So bring [GO] back the beat and then everyone sing [1]

[CHORUS]
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag [1]

Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
