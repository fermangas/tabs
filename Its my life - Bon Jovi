Scream ON
Voice Box ON


This ain't a song for [same pitch] the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
[Hook full octave down] I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

It's my [ma lafe long 'l' tall 'a'] life
It's now or never
[Hook octave] I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
[On 3] It's my [no life] life
        My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive [no need to stress]
It's my life

[Yeah] This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina [exhale] who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, gotta make your own breaks

It's my [long 'l'] life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
[Not sang] It's my life
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my [descending] life

[Solo]

You better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

[Chorus x2]
[High] It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
[Not sang] It's my life
     [High] My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
